So how do you create a songbook with Linkesoft SongBook? Here are the steps:

1. Download and install Linkesoft SongBook on your Windows PC from [their website](https://www.linkesoft.com/songbook/). You can also buy it from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/songbook/9nblggh4q0xw?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).
2. At first program start, select the directory where your songs will be stored. The default is `<My Documents>\My Songs`. You can change the song directory at any time with the "..." button next to the category dropdown[^2^].
3. If you already have some songs in chordpro format, you can copy them to your song directory or import them from other sources. If you don't have any songs yet, you can find some online by searching for the song title and chordpro. You can also create your own songs by writing the lyrics as usual and inserting the chord names in square brackets at the appropriate positions[^2^]. For example:

        [Em]Alas, my [G]love, you [D]do me [Bm]wrong,
        To [C]cast me off dis[G]courteously.
        For [Em]I have loved you [G]well and [D]long,
        De[Bm]lighting [Em]in your [D]com[Em]pany.

4. Once you have some songs in your song directory, you can organize them into categories, playlists, and tags. You can also edit them with the built-in editor or an external editor of your choice. You can also add metadata such as title, subtitle, artist, composer, key, tempo, capo, etc. to your songs[^2^].
5. To play a song, just double-click on it or press Enter. You can then use the toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts to transpose, zoom, scroll, mark, or print the song. You can also tap or click on a chord to see its diagram or definition[^2^].
6. To share a song or a playlist with others, you can export it as PDF, HTML, TXT, or ChordPro file. You can also sync your songs with other devices using Dropbox, Google Drive, or MS OneDrive[^1^].
